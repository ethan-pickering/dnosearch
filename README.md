Source code for Deep Neural Operator (DeepONet) Bayesian experimental design (i.e. active learning) and optimization with likelihood-weighted acquisition functions. 

## Installation

Execute `pip install .` from the master directory.

## Notes

Change all of these notes for DeepONet issues
Beware of [this issue](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy/issues/802) if you are using the `devel` version of `GPy`.
